NBA shooting prediction

In this masterâ€™s thesis in Data Science / Data Analysis, I am analyzing shooting actions data from the most recent NBA season, aiming to identify the key factors that influence shot success. The analysis focuses on both quantitative aspects, such as player positioning and shot conditions, and temporal and contextual elements.

To obtain accurate and detailed information, a crucial part of the data collection is performed through advanced computer vision techniques, using YOLOv8 to detect players on the court and precisely determine their positions during each shooting action. Additionally, by extracting video data synchronized with timestamps, I can accurately map game sequences.

This combination of statistical analysis, machine learning, and computer vision enables me to build predictive models and decision-support tools to optimize shooting strategies, thereby improving on-court performance and providing valuable insights for coaches and players alike.
